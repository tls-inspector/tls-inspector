explanation::bad_authority	The certificate for this host was issued by a known dangerous certificate authority.
explanation::invalid_date	The server certificate for this site is not trusted because one or more certificates in the chain is expired or not yet valid.
explanation::issue_date_too_long	The server certificate is valid for more than 825 days. Certificates with excessive validity periods are not considered secure as they may become weak as they age.
explanation::leaf_keyusage	The server certificate for this site is invalid and is missing the required Server Authentication key usage.
explanation::local_trust	Your device has been configured to trust this certificate, even if it wouldn't have otherwise.
explanation::revoked	The server certificate for this site is not trusted by the system because is has been revoked by the certificate authority.
explanation::self_signed	The server certificate for this site is not trusted by the system because the root certificate authority is unknown or not present.
explanation::sha1_int	The intermediate certificate for this site is signed using SHA-1, which is no longer considered secure.
explanation::sha1_leaf	The server certificate for this site is signed using SHA-1, which is no longer considered secure.
explanation::trust	The server certificate for this site is trusted by the system because the root certificate authority is trusted.
explanation::untrusted	The server certificate for this site is not trusted by the system because the server certificate is incorrect.
explanation::weak_rsa	The server or issuing certificate is signed using a weak RSA key (contains less than 2048 bits of data).
explanation::wrong_host	The server certificate is for a different host than the one connected to.

secure::bad_authority	No. Certificate authorities need to adhere to internationally accepted standards. The authority that issued the certificate for this host is known to be in violation of these standards\n\nEXERCISE EXTREME CAUTION. VISITING WEBSITES THAT USE KNOWN BAD CERTIFICATE AUTHORITIES EXPOSES YOUR PRIVACY AND SECURITY TO EXTREME DANGER.
secure::invalid_date	Most likely. An expired or not-yet-valid certificate isn't necessarily invalid, but often a mistake by the site administrator, or your phone's time settings being incorrect.
secure::issue_date_too_long	Most likely. Apple changed requirements for certificates in iOS 13 to enforce shorter validity periods.
secure::leaf_keyusage	Most likely. A certificate that is missing the key usage parameter is likely still valid otherwise.
secure::local_trust	Unlikely. Some enterprise or corporate networks may use these types of certificates for internal or private websites. However, it may also be an indication of a compromised device or network.
secure::revoked	No. One or more certificates for this site have been revoked, meaning the certificates are no longer trustworthy.\n\nExercise caution if continuing to this website.
secure::self_signed	No. The certificate for this site was not issued by any known certificate authority and therefor your device has no way of checking if the certificate is actually for the website and not an attacker.\n\nExercise extreme caution if continuing to this website.
secure::sha1_int	No. While currently unlikely, it may be possible for an attacker to craft a fake certificate that takes advantage of the weakness of SHA-1.\n\nExercise caution if continuing to this website.
secure::sha1_leaf	No. While currently unlikely, it may be possible for an attacker to craft a fake certificate that takes advantage of the weakness of SHA-1.\n\nExercise caution if continuing to this website.
secure::trust	Yes. Your device has determined that the connection to this site is secure.
secure::untrusted	No. Your device was unable to check if the certificate presented by the website actually belongs to the website, and not somebody else.\n\nExercise extreme caution if continuing to this website.
secure::weak_rsa	No. One or more certificates for this host are using weak cryptography and are not considered secure.
secure::wrong_host	No. Because the certificate presented by the server was for another site there is no way to be sure that this certificate is not dangerous.\n\nIt's likely that the request to this site was redirected to another site, such as a Wi-Fi sign on page.\n\nExercise caution if continuing to this website.
securedns_description	DNS over HTTPS is a technology that uses encrypted connections when resolving domain names to IP addresses. Compared to traditional DNS, DNS over HTTPS offers inproved privacy and security at a small performance cost.
securedns_fallback_description	If enabled, TLS Inspector will prefer to the the selected DNS over HTTPS server. If the server is unreachable, TLS Inspector will instead use the system's DNS resolver.
