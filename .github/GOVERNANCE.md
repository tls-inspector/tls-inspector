# TLS Inspector Project Governance

This document describes the governance of the TLS Inspector project, who holds what privileges, and how decisions are made.

TLS Inspector was originally created and continues to be supported primarily by Ian Spence. TLS Inspector is a **Benevolent Dictator For Life** (BDFL) project. In brief, a BDFL leader retains full control over all decisions for the project.

## Decisions

The TLS Inspector project is not a democracy, all decisions are ultiamtely up to the project leader. However, everybody is welcome to participate in discussions and argue on their beliefs for the project.

## Donations

As the TLS Inspector project is not a legal entity, it is not possible to donate directly to the project. Instead, donations are routed to the project's leader.

Donations do not grant individuals any power within the project and donations are not considered when making project decisions.
